## Project Title - GrocerSmart - A smart grocery store management application for store managers

### Introduction - AI is one of the most powerful tool that we use in business today. With correct data we can use the power of AI to take important decisons in our business and also to plan our inventory and products. Our application will use this power of AI to help grocery shop owners determine which products they should promote and what shpuld be the price of the product and its effect on sales.

### Abstract - This application will answer the two most important questions to retailers - which products they should promote and what should be its price. For this, we will use the past data of Big mart sales. This dataset includes thousands of items sold at different outlets of Big mart. The training data includes item price, item information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the unit sales. From this we can predict which items are sold more and which items we should promote.
